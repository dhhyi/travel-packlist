# Privacy Policy

This document explains how your data is handled by the TravelPacklist.
It handles both cases for the Web App and the Android App.

## What data is stored or collected?

The app stores all of the entered data locally in either your browser's local storage (in case of the Web App) or on your device's local App cache (in case of the Android App).
No other data than the data you enter is stored or collected.

## Is this data shared with any server?

The data is never sent to any external server.
It is only stored locally on your device.
Pleas also regularly backup your data using the export feature.

## What permissions does the App require?

The App is originally designed to use browser built-in features for storing and sharing data.
This means that no additional permissions are required.
The Android App uses Capacitor to wrap the Web App into a native App, so it also uses your phone's browser features for storing and sharing data.

## How can I delete my data?

You can delete all data by clearing your browser's local storage (in case of the Web App) or by clearing the App cache (in case of the Android App).
Please note that this will delete all data and cannot be undone.
You can also use the red "Reset Application" button in the settings to delete all entered data.

## How can I contact the developer?

Please refer to the contact details in the App's settings page.
If you installed this App from the Google Play Store, you can also use the contact details provided there.
