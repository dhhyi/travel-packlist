# Releasing

## Check contents of the release

Either check the git log since the last tag or run `pnpm run changelog -u` to see the changelog including the unreleased content.

Depending on the content, release:

- a **patch** version if the changes only fix bugs.
- a **minor** version if the changes also add functionality.

## Create a new release

Run `pnpm run version <patch|minor>` (see above) to create a new release.
This will use npm built-in versioning to bump the version in `package.json` and create an entry to the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Publish the release

Push both the tag and the main branch to the upstream repository.
The pipeline will automatically build all the artifacts (Android and GitHub Pages) as well as create a new GitHub release.

## Publish the package in the Google Play Store

Log into the console and publish a new release using the AAB file generated by the build on the release page.
